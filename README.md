# Hi, I'm Aanal Patel

**Generative AI Engineer** building production-ready intelligent systems.

I design and deploy end-to-end AI systems, spanning data ingestion, feature engineering, model development, optimization, and scalable API deployment on cloud infrastructure. My work focuses on building reliable, measurable machine learning and LLM solutions that integrate directly into real business workflows. I’ve developed production ML systems for churn prediction, forecasting, and sentiment analysis, engineered scalable ETL pipelines using Spark and Airflow, and deployed models via FastAPI on AWS. In addition, I build agentic AI solutions using platforms like n8n, Make.com, and Zapier to automate decision workflows, reduce manual effort, and improve operational efficiency across teams.

## What I Build

- Generative AI systems (RAG pipelines, LLM fine-tuning, agentic workflows)
- Machine learning models (classification, regression, clustering, time-series)
- End-to-end ML systems (data → training → optimization → deployment → monitoring)
- Decision optimization systems using statistical and cost-sensitive modeling
- Automation workflows that connect models to business processes

## How I Think About AI

I approach AI as a systems problem:

**Data → Modeling → Optimization → Deployment → Feedback Loop**

I care about:
- Clean architecture
- Reproducibility
- Performance under constraints
- Automation and scalability
- Real-world impact over benchmark-only results: Business Result / Aim getting achieved 

---

## Currently Exploring

- Efficient vision transformers
- Multimodal AI systems
- LLM evaluation and reliability
- Production optimization for large-scale ML systems
- Reliability on Agentic AI solutions in Security measures / asking a question: Are they safe to use ?
