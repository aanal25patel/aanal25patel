# Hi, I'm Aanal Patel

**Generative AI & Machine Learning Engineer** building production-ready intelligent systems.

I design and deploy end-to-end AI pipelines, from data engineering and model development to scalable APIs and cloud deployment. My focus is on making machine learning and LLM systems reliable, measurable, and impactful in real-world workflows.

---

## What I Build

- Generative AI systems (RAG pipelines, LLM fine-tuning, agentic workflows)
- Machine learning models (classification, regression, clustering, time-series)
- Computer vision pipelines (image processing, deep learning-based models)
- End-to-end ML systems (data → training → optimization → deployment → monitoring)
- Decision optimization systems using statistical and cost-sensitive modeling
- Automation workflows that connect models to business processes

## How I Think About AI

I approach AI as a systems problem:

**Data → Modeling → Optimization → Deployment → Feedback Loop**

I care about:
- Clean architecture
- Reproducibility
- Performance under constraints
- Automation and scalability
- Real-world impact over benchmark-only results

---

## Currently Exploring

- Efficient vision transformers
- Multimodal AI systems
- LLM evaluation and reliability
- Production optimization for large-scale ML systems
